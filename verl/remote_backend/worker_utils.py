"""Backend-agnostic tensor + metric helpers shared across per-backend
forwarder workers.

Per-backend forwarder workers ship in adapter packages (verl core carries
none). Any such worker can pull generic nested-jagged reconstruction /
metric normalization from this module without importing another
backend's Worker class or its single-controller dispatch decorators.

Each per-backend worker keeps its own payload-encoding decisions on
its adapter's compute/update methods (the ABC intentionally doesn't
fix those signatures); these helpers cover the small set of generic
transformations a worker needs around those calls:

* :func:`make_njt` — reconstruct a nested-jagged tensor from a dense
  ``[B, L]`` tensor returned by a backend, using the offsets carried in
  ``data["input_ids"]``.
* :func:`normalize_backend_metrics` — coerce whatever shape a backend
  put in its ``metrics`` dict (a :class:`Metric`, a list of them, a list
  of bare scalars, or a bare scalar) into the canonical verl
  :class:`Metric` form (or a pass-through list when the trainer needs
  to aggregate later).
